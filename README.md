# üé¨ Movie Recommendation System with K-Means Clustering
Project Overview
This is a  machine learning project that builds a movie recommendation system using learning techniques. The system groups similar movies together and recommends films based on shared characteristics.

# üéØ What This Project Does
Core Functionality:

Analyzes 100 real movies with features like genres, ratings, year, duration, and budget

Groups similar movies into clusters using K-means algorithm

Recommends movies based on cluster similarity

Visualizes results with interactive plots and charts

# How Recommendations Work:

You input a movie you like (e.g., "The Dark Knight")

System finds which cluster that movie belongs to

Recommends other highly-rated movies from the same cluster

Results are ranked by rating and relevance


# üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack
Libraries Used:

pandas - Data manipulation and analysis

numpy - Numerical computing
